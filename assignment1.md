###Objective: Clarity and accuracy

•	Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 

Yes, the central insight of the story is immediately identifiable through both the heading and the lead. The article talks about how coronavirus is infecting and killing African Americans at a disproportionate rate, and the article establishes the point from the very beginning. I would rate it a 5 on the scale.

•	Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent.

While I was able to understand how to navigate the data easily, I believe the layout was a bit disorganized with descriptions being provided on only one graph. As such, I rate it a 3 on the scale. 

As for improvement, I would suggest a slide format, with each slide representing the data from each state. Within each slide, the fatality rate of other ethnicities would also be shown, although in lighter colors, while the fatality graph of African Americans would be shown as a bold line and in bright colors, making it easily noticeable.

•	Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate.

The article used data cited from Johns Hopkins University, state health departments and American Community Survey. The data seems quite accurate and, thus, I would rate it a 5 on the scale. 

The article also does a good job of explaining what needed to be explained about the data and the related analysis.


###Objective: Quality

•	Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)

The story was definitely executed at a high degree of quality. Not only does it analyze the data to bring out an important story, it also delves into what might be the reasons behind the higher susceptibility of African Americans to coronavirus. It also brings in statements from U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams. As an African American who has been involved greatly with the public healthcare system, his statements not only add gravitas tot the story, it also makes it personal for the readers. However, it fails to include the opinions of African Americans who are not associated with the government. As such, there is a lack of the picture of the average African American and there take on this matter. Thus, I rate this a 4 on the scale.

•	Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)

One of the first things a data story must have is good presentation. It should be able to attract the attention of the reader while also being easily understandable at the same time. This article, despite its reporting quality, has a lackluster presentation. The graphic doesn’t stand out and it can be confusing at first glance.

It should also present a good comparison of the highlighted data with the background data, both to give the story a context as well as to give the reader an idea of the scale. While the story itself does a good job in comparing the fatality rate of African Americans due to coronavirus against the fatality rate of other ethnicities, the graph itself only points out the African American data.

Organization is also an important part of a data story. The reader should have complete freedom in analyzing the presented data from different angles, without getting confused or lost by the lack of organization in the data presented. As mentioned before, the graph only shows the data from African Americans. It makes it difficult for the reader to grab the central insight of the story from the graph. The layout of the different graphs is also extremely cluttered and very disorganized.

Finally, correlation is absolutely necessary to cement the idea that the analysis of the data, without a doubt, proves what the story is trying to say. The data presented in the story definitely proves the point that the article is trying to make. It also delves in detail into the reason behind why the African Americans might be more vulnerable to coronavirus.


###Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

•	Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?

As for the type in the graphic, minimum text was used in the charts. It describes the axes for only one chart. While fading lines on the graph relating the data of other ethnicities can be seen on the background, the graphic doesn’t describe them. I rate this 1 on the basis of type.

The overall color of the graph is not eye-catching, and the other lines in the background are not very legible. To signify the African American fatality graph, they use the color pink. Red would be better to highlight the lines as they are the central point of the story. I give it a 2 out of 5.


###Objective: Creativity

•	Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?

The chart in the article are lackluster, but the spreadsheet later in the story does a good job in painting a clear picture of the data comparison. There is also a picture of Jerome Adams, which adds personality to the story. But other than that, there are not much creative elements in the story. I rate it 2 out of 5.


##Story 2

###Objective: Clarity and accuracy

•	Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. 

Yes, the central insight of the story is immediately identifiable through both the heading and the lead. The story talks about how despite more coronavirus-related deaths in New York, the spread of the infection is slowing down. I would rate it a 5 on the scale.

•	Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? Again, use a 5- point scale with 5 = excellent.

While I was able to understand how to navigate the data easily, I would suggest making a bigger chart, and laying out the time period in detail. Other than that, the data was easily navigable. As such, I rate it a 5 on the scale. 

•	Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate.

The article used data cited by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and mayor Bill de Blasio. The data seems quite accurate, but it would be better to include detailed data from the state health department, non-profit surveys or even field experts. Thus, I would rate it a 4 on the scale. 

The article also does a good job of explaining what needed to be explained about the data and the related analysis.

##Objective: Quality

•	Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)

The story was definitely executed at a high degree of quality. Not only does it analyze the data to bring out an important story, it also went into great detail to show how the normal people were dealing with the situation, like how Easter was celebrated at a distance. It also includes the opinions of figures from the administration like Cuomo and de Blasio. I rate this as 5.

•	Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)

One of the first things a data story must have is good presentation. It should be able to attract the attention of the reader while also being easily understandable at the same time. This article has a nice presentation where the story drops in important details without much delay, yet the narrative flows smoothly. 

It should also present a good comparison of various kinds of data, both to give the story a context as well as to give the reader an idea of the scale. The data presented does a good job in making clear that while the situation is still dire, there have been improvements in flattening the curve.

Organization is also an important part of a data story. The reader should have complete freedom in analyzing the presented data from different angles, without getting confused or lost by the lack of organization in the data presented. The chart as well as the story presents an easy to understand fluctuation in numbers, making the central insight of the story very clear.

Finally, correlation is absolutely necessary to cement the idea that the analysis of the data, without a doubt, proves what the story is trying to say. The data presented in the story definitely proves the point that the article is trying to make. It doesn’t exaggerate the implication of the available data and only communicates what is proven.


##Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

•	Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?

As for the type in the graphic, minimum text was used in the chart. But the number of cases as well as deaths from coronavirus in New York is distinctly displayed on the chart and can be easily noticed. The chart also combines a column chart with a line chart, giving an accurate impression of the frequent fluctuations in the number of daily cases, while also correctly and easily following the curve over a specific time period. But it would be better if the scale of the chart was bigger. I rate it a 4 out of 5.

The overall color of the graph is not eye-catching, but the pink color of the column chart is very distinct from the red of the line chart. The choice of red to signify the outbreak curve is also a good choice. I give it a 4 out of 5.


##Objective: Creativity

•	Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?

The chart in the article is not very impressive, but article itself is frequently punctuated with relevant images. It also frequently provides ordered lists of the available data, as well as links to relevant updates and tracking maps. It also involves a Frequently Asked Questions section. I rate it a 4 out of 5.
